The trimmed synonym dictionary is used for one of my studies on [data augmentation](https://github.com/jaaack-wang/linguistic-knowledge-in-DA-for-NLP). The current trimmed version availble here is a bit aggressive but you can do it in your only way taking the `synonymsTrimming.ipynb` notebook for reference. The `revised_syn.json` is the [synonyms.json](https://github.com/jaaack-wang/Chinese-Synonyms/blob/main/synonyms.json) in the previous folder with some manual trimming for those frequently used words where I found many problems.
